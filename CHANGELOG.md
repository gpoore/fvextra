# Changelog


## v1.13.2 (dev)

*  Fixed a bug that prevented detecting characters with a `\mathcode` of
   `"8000` under XeTeX and LuaTeX (gpoore/minted#451).



## v1.13.1 (2025/05/25)

*  Replaced `\mathcode` with `\Umathcodenum` under XeTeX (#31).



## v1.13.0 (2025/05/14)

*  Enhanced `\VerbatimPygments` support for Pygments options `escapeinside`
   and `texcomments`.  Pygments escape tokens are now always retokenized using
   the catcodes in place before the verbatim context.  Pygments comment tokens
   are also retokenized if the new option `texcomments=true`.  This makes
   these tokens behave more like regular LaTeX; previously, `\active`
   characters could produce unexpected or undesired results
   (gpoore/minted#303, gpoore/minted#312, gpoore/minted#422).

*  Fixed a bug that caused some Pygments output to vanish when using
   `\VerbatimPygments` with `breaklines=false` but `breakanywhere=true`
   (gpoore/minted#442).

*  `\VerbatimPygments` now patches Pygments macros to work correctly when the
   plus sign `+` is `\active` or otherwise has a modified catcode.

*  Added `\FVExtraSaveCodes` and `\FVExtraUseCodes`.  These save the catcodes
   of all characters in `\FVExtraDoSpecials`, and then restore them.  All
   commands and environments now automatically save the catcodes in place when
   they begin.  These can be restored via `\FancyVerbRestoreCodes`.

*  Replaced `\FV@SetupMathLigs` with `\FV@SetupMathActive`.  This makes all
   characters in `\FVExtraDoSpecials` behave more normally within math,
   instead of only patching `` ` ``, `<`, `>`, `,`, `'`, and `-`.

   `\active` versions of characters are now defined in a way that avoids
   infinite loops for characters with a `\mathcode` of `"8000`.  This fixes
   compatibility with packages like `semantic` (gpoore/minted#422).

   `\FV@SetupMathActive` makes `\FV@SetupMathSpace` and `\FancyVerbMathSpace`
   redundant, so these were removed.

*  Added `\FV@UseKeyValues@Hook`.  This is at the very end of
   `\FV@UseKeyValues`.  It is useful for modifications like
   `\FV@SetupMathActive` that need to occur very early within a command or
   environment.

*  Improved compatibility with the LaTeX Tagged PDF project by modifying
   patch for `\FV@List` (#29).

*  All hooks now have a default value of empty, instead of some being `\let`
   to `\relax`.  This fixes compatibility with `\FV@AddToHook`.



## v1.12.0 (2025/03/04)

*  Added command `\IterateBuffer` for iterating over buffers and applying a
   macro to each line.

*  Added command `\BufferMdfivesum` that calculates the MD5 sum of the current
   buffer.

*  Added command `\WriteBuffer` that writes a buffer to file.  This is the
   buffer equivalent of `VerbatimWrite`.

*  Added new options for `\InsertBuffer`:  `wrapperenvname`, `wrapperenvopt`,
   `wrapperenvarg`.  Improved implementation of `\InsertBuffer` to eliminate
   temp macros.

*  Optimized line breaking for very long lines (#28).



## v1.11.0 (2025/02/09)

*  Added command `\InsertBuffer`.  This inserts an existing buffer created
   with `VerbatimBuffer` so that it is interpreted as LaTeX.

*  Added `\ClearBuffer` as an alias for `\VerbatimClearBuffer`.

*  When `afterbuffer` is used with `VerbatimBuffer` or derived environments to
   typeset the buffer, the typeset buffer may now contain `VerbatimBuffer` or
   environments based on it.  Previously, nested buffering overwrote temp
   macros and produced incorrect results.  Typically, nested buffering should
   be avoided for a given buffer; a different buffer should be used at each
   level of nesting.  The current buffer depth is now available in
   `\FancyVerbBufferDepth`.

*  Added option `backgroundcolorboxoverlap` and alias `bgcolorboxoverlap`.
   When there is a background color for a block of text, this oversizes the
   `\colorbox` behind each line by `backgroundcolorboxoverlap`, and then
   slightly overlaps these boxes by the same amount.  Some PDF viewers and
   browsers produce rendering artifacts with a background color.  These appear
   in between lines of text as extremely thin horizontal rules that are the
   color of the page behind the background.  `backgroundcolorboxoverlap`
   eliminates rendering artifacts in most software that produces them, and
   otherwise significantly reduces artifacts (gpoore/minted#429).

*  Line breaking now works with very long lines (#28).  Previously, very long
   lines could result in a "Dimension too large" error if they were longer
   than `\maxdimen`, or no error and also no line breaking if they were so
   long that the length overflowed and became negative.

*  Renamed `\FV@bufferlengthname` to `\FancyVerbBufferLengthName`.  Added
   documentation for `\FancyVerbBufferLengthName` and
   `\FancyVerbBufferLineName`.



## v1.10.0 (2024/11/17)

*  Replaced `FancyVerbBufferIndex` counter with `\FancyVerbBufferIndex` macro
   to prevent issues with commands and environments such as `\text` from
   `amsmath` that modify counter behavior.



## v1.9.0 (2024/10/16)

*  Replaced buffer length counters with macros to prevent issues with
   `\includeonly` resetting counters.



## v1.8.0 (2024/09/14)

*  Added new option `backgroundcolor` (alias `bgcolor`).  This provides a
   basic, `\colorbox`-based implementation of background colors for commands
   and environments.  Added new option `backgroundcolorvphantom` (alias
   `bgcolorvphantom`) for customizing background height.  Added new option
   `backgroundcolorpadding` (alias `bgcolorpadding`) for customizing padding
   between text and the edge of the region with background color.

*  Added option `insertenvname`.  This customizes the verbatim environment
   used by `\VerbatimInsertBuffer`.

*  When `numberblanklines=false`, `highlightlines` no longer highlights blank
   lines at the end of a highlighted range (#25, gpoore/minted#226).

*  An unnecessary line break is no longer inserted before the last "word" of a
   line when it is preceded by a long "word" that is broken internally as a
   result of `breakbefore`, `breakafter`, or `breakanywhere` (#26).

*  Added option `breakpreferspaces` (default `true`).  This determines whether
   line breaks are preferentially inserted at normal spaces rather than at
   other locations allowed by `breakbefore`, `breakafter`, or `breakanywhere`
   (#26).

*  Added option `breakanywhereinlinestretch` (gpoore/minted#387).

*  `\FVExtraReadVArg` now takes a multi-line (but not multi-paragraph)
   verbatim argument.  The new `\FVExtraReadVArgSingleLine` provides the old
   functionality of taking an argument restricted to a single line
   (gpoore/minted#376).

*  By default, `\Verb` and `\SaveVerb` now take multi-line (but not
   multi-paragraph) verbatim arguments.  The old behavior of requiring
   verbatim arguments to be on a single line can be restored by setting the
   new option `vargsingleline` to `true`.

*  Added documentation for undocumented `fancyvrb` option `listparameters`
   (gpoore/minted#256).

*  Expanded `breaklines` documentation with discussion of limitations and
   alternatives (gpoore/minted#400).



## v1.7.0 (2024/05/16)

*  Added new command `\VerbatimClearBuffer`.

*  `VerbatimBuffer` environments with the same buffer name now append to the
   same buffer, regardless of the value of `globalbuffer`.  Previously,
   `globalbuffer=false` caused any pre-existing buffer to be cleared.  Now,
   `globalbuffer=false` causes anything that is appended to the buffer to be
   removed at the end of the environment, but the entire buffer is not
   cleared.

*  `\FVExtraUnexpandedReadStarOArgMArgBVArg` now checks that the final
   argument it reads is braced (#22).

*  Text that immediately follows `\VerbatimInsertBuffer` is no longer indented
   to start a new paragraph.

*  Updated `tcblisting` usage in docs for compatibility with the latest
   `tcolorbox`.


## v1.6.1 (2023/11/28)

*  Fixed bug from v1.6 that caused a space following a comma to be lost (#21).


## v1.6 (2023/11/19)

*  Added new environment `VerbatimWrite`.  This is similar to `fancyvrb`'s
   `VerbatimOut`, except that it allows for writing to a file multiple times
   and guarantees truly verbatim output via `\detokenize`.

*  Added new environment `VerbatimBuffer`.  This stores the contents of an
   environment verbatim in a "buffer," a sequence of numbered macros each of
   which contains one line of the environment.  The "buffered" lines can then
   be looped over for further processing or later use.

*  Added new command `\VerbatimInsertBuffer`.  This inserts an existing buffer
   created by `VerbatimBuffer` as a `Verbatim` environment.

*  Redefined visible space `\FancyVerbSpace` so that it now has the correct
   width.  It had previously been redefined as `\textvisiblespace`, but that
   was slightly too narrrow.

*  Added option `spacebreak`.  This determines the line break that is inserted
   around spaces when `showspaces=true` or `breakcollapsespaces=false`, by
   defining the new macro `\FancyVerbSpaceBreak`.

*  `breakbefore`, `breakafter`, and `breakanywhere` now produce plain breaks
   around spaces when `showspaces=true`, instead of breaks with a break symbol
   at the end of wrapped lines.  `\FancyVerbBreakAnywhereBreak`,
   `\FancyVerbBreakBeforeBreak`, and `\FancyVerbBreakAfterBreak` are no longer
   inserted next to spaces.  Instead, `\FancyVerbSpaceBreak` is inserted or
   (depending on options) `\FV@Space` is defined to include
   `\FancyVerbSpaceBreak`.

*  Added option `breakcollapsespaces`.  When `true` (default), a line break
   within a run of regular spaces (`showspaces=false`) replaces all spaces
   with a single break, and the wrapped line after the break starts with a
   non-space character.  When `false`, a line break within a run of regular
   spaces preserves all spaces, and the wrapped line after the break may start
   with one or more spaces.  This causes regular spaces to behave exactly like
   the visible spaces produced with `showspaces`; both give identical line
   breaks, with the only difference being the appearance of spaces.

*  `breaklines` now automatically enables breaks after space characters when
   `showspaces=true`.

*  Reimplemented definition of `\FV@Space` to work with new space options.

*  Added documentation about how reimplemented commands handle the `codes`
   option differently compared to `fancyvrb` (#17).

*  Starred commands such as `\Verb*` now use both visible spaces and visible
   tabs instead of just visible spaces.  This is more similar to the current
   behavior of `\verb*`, except that `\verb*` converts tabs into visible
   spaces (#19).

*  The `mathescape` option now resets the ampersand `&` catcode (#18).


## v1.5 (2022/11/30)

*  Added `\FancyVerbFormatInline` for customizing the formatting of inline
   verbatim, such as `\Verb`.  This parallels `\FancyVerbFormatLine` and
   `\FancyVerbFormatText`.

*  Added line breaking option `breaknonspaceingroup`.  When `commandchars` is
   used to allow macros within verbatim, this inserts breaks within groups
   `{...}`.

*  Added `\FVExtraUnexpandedReadStarOArgMArgBVArg` to support reimplementation
   of `\mintinline` for `minted`.

*  Added `VerbEnv` environment, which is an environment variant of `\Verb`.
   This supports reimplementation of `\mintinline` for `minted`.

*  `breakbefore` and `breakafter` now support the escaped comma `\,` (#15).

*  Fixed unintended line breaks after hyphens under LuaTeX (#14).

*  Added documentation on Pandoc compatibility (#11).

*  Replaced `breakbeforegroup` with `breakbeforeinrun`, and replaced
   `breakaftergroup` with `breakafterinrun`.  With the introduction of
   `breaknonspaceingroup`, "`group`" is now reserved for referring to TeX
   groups `{...}`.

*  Removed dependency on `ifthen` package.

*  `breakautoindent` now works correctly with Pygments output that treats
   leading whitespace as a separate token or as part of a token.


## v1.4 (2019/02/04)

*  Reimplemented `\Verb`.  It now works as expected inside other commands
   (with a few limitations), including in movable arguments, and is compatible
   with `hyperref` for things like PDF bookmarks.  It now supports
   `breaklines` and relevant line-breaking options.

*  Reimplemented `\SaveVerb` and `\UseVerb` to be equivalent to the new
   `\Verb`.  The new option `retokenize` allows saved verbatim material to be
   retokenized under new `commandchars` and `codes` when it is inserted with
   `\UseVerb`.

*  New command `\EscVerb` works like the reimplemented `\Verb`, except that
   special characters can be escaped with a backslash.  It works inside other
   commands without any limitations, including in movable arguments, and is
   compatible with `hyperref` for things like PDF bookmarks.

*  Added `extra` option for switching between the reimplemented  `\Verb`,
   `\SaveVerb`, `\UseVerb` and the original `fancyvrb` definitions.
   Reimplemented versions are used by default.  This option will apply to any
   future reimplemented commands and environments.

*  New command `\fvinlineset` only applies options to commands related to
   typesetting verbatim inline, like `\Verb`, `\SaveVerb`, `\UseVerb`.  It
   only works with commands that are defined or reimplemented by `fvextra`.
   It overrides options from `\fvset`.

*  Patched `fancyvrb` so that `\Verb` (either reimplemented version or
   original) can use characters like `%` for delimiters when used outside any
   commands.

*  `obeytabs` now works with the `calc` package's redefined `\setcounter`.
    Since `minted` loads `calc`, this also fixes `minted` compatibility
    (`minted` #221).

*  Added new option `fontencoding` (`minted` #208).

*  `highlightlines` now works correctly with `frame` (#7).


## v1.3.1 (2017/07/08)

* `beameroverlays` now works with `VerbatimOut`.


## v1.3 (2017/07/08)

*  Added `beameroverlays` option, which enables `beamer` overlays using the
   `<` and `>` characters.

*  Added options `breakindentnchars`, `breaksymbolsepleftnchars` (alias
   `breaksymbolsepnchars`), `breaksymbolseprightnchars`,
   `breaksymbolindentleftnchars` (alias `breaksymbolindentnchars`), and
   `breaksymbolindentrightnchars`.  These are identical to the pre-existing
   options without the `nchars` suffix, except that they allow indentation to
   be specified as an integer number of characters rather than as a dimension.
   As a result of these new options, `\settowidth` is no longer used in the
   preamble, resolving some font incompatibilities (#4).

*  Clarified in the docs that `breaksymbolsepright` is a *minimum*, rather
   than exact, distance.


## v1.2.1 (2016/09/02)

*  The package is now compatible with classes and packages that redefine
   `\raggedright`.

*  Fixed a bug that introduced extra space in inline contexts such as
   `\mintinline` when `breaklines=true` (#3).



## v1.2 (2016/07/20)

*  Added support for line breaking when working with Pygments for syntax
   highlighting.

* The default `highlightcolor` is now defined with `rgb` for compatibility
  with the `color` package.  Fixed a bug in the conditional color definition
  when `color` and `xcolor` are not loaded before `fvextra`.



## v1.1 (2016/07/14)

*  The options `rulecolor` and `fillcolor` now accept color names directly;
   using `\color{<color_name>}` is no longer necessary, though it still works.

*  Added `tabcolor` and `spacecolor` options for use with `showtabs` and
   `showspaces`.

*  Added `highlightlines` option that takes a line number or range of line
   numbers and highlights the corresponding lines.  Added `highlightcolor`
   option that controls highlighting color.

*  `obeytabs` no longer causes lines to vanish when tabs are inside macro
   arguments.  Tabs and spaces inside a macro argument but otherwise at the
   beginning of a line are expanded correctly.  Tabs inside a macro argument
   that are preceded by non-whitespace characters (not spaces or tabs) are
   expanded based on the starting position of the run of whitespace in which
   they occur.

*  The line breaking options `breakanywhere`, `breakbefore`, and `breakafter`
   now work with multi-byte UTF-8 code points under pdfTeX with `inputenc`.
   They were already fully functional under XeTeX and LuaTeX.

*  Added `curlyquotes` option, which essentially disables the `uquote` package.



## v1.0 (2016/06/28)

*  Initial release.
